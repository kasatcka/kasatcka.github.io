Аbout twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening</p>
          <p>&nbsp;bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>

          <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, &nbsp;and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.<br><span class="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span>"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"<span class="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br><em class="text-style-3">“</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="text-style-4">The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.</em></p>
